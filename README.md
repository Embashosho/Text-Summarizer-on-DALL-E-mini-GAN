# Text-Summarizer-on-DALL-E-mini-GAN
application of a text summarizer on a text-to-image based Generative Adversarial Network. Only Pre-trained Models were used in this Demo. Facebooks BART transformers 
were used as the summarizer model while DALL E mini was used as the text to image GAN architecture.
For large texts of size approx 1600 words, the text was split into individual chunks of about 200 words to better capture the information in those words and reduce runtimes.
